# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Analytics Engineer

First of all, thank you for taking the time to review my submission!

In this repository, you'll find my submission for the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise (Analytics Engineer Intern).

I've included 4 files, corresponding to the 4 tasks specified in the exercise. Each file has the task number as a prefix. The raw `.json` files have also been included in the `/data` folder.
- task1_er_diagram.pdf
- task2_sql_queries.sql

## Task 1: ER Diagram

Task 1 is an ER Diagram that details how I designed the data model according to the raw `.json` files provided.

## Task 2: SQL File

Task 2 is a `.sql` file that:
- Creates the data model
- Inputs sample data
- Executes queries to address the 6 business questions that were posed

Task 3 is a `.py` file that explores the data quality of the `.json` files. In this task:

The analysis is sectioned by dataset, and findings are included intermittently throughout the analysis.
